# SkillSwap
SkillSwap is a peer-to-peer learning platform designed to make education more accessible, flexible, and community-driven. Traditional learning methods are often expensive, time-bound, or inaccessible to many. SkillSwap bridges this gap by allowing users to exchange skills directly â€” learn something new by teaching what you already know.
